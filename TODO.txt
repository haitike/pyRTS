You can select units from all players, enemies or not (Red Circle in enemies)
Vision Fog
Attack: Calcule range distances to enemy sides, not to center (useful for big targets)
4 facing angles [8-angles better?] (full angle slows the game) --> Angle variable in classes
dont "move" in the ID_Attack State when the unit is chasing (temporal fix for the facing angle).
Stop and Hold Position Keys and States

Fix: engine.py "Updates and Draw" Section. It draws harvest Progress with Passive[0] but the harverst passive could be another index.
Right now Mineral in a mineral patch must be multple of Harvest amount. Example: if you set Mineral patch to 57 HP, workers will get 60 from them.
